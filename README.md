Work Evidence
=========

My learning application in Django.

If you work for somebody and you need to keep a records of about that is that app for you.

You can:
* maintain list of customers
* maintain evidence of work done for customers
* display records with some filtering (year/month/customer) and two styles: timeline and by the customers.

Application use I18n and is translatable. Views and templates use i18n posibilities of Django.


Requirements
------------
* Python, tested on 2.7
* Django, tested on 1.5 and 1.6 and 1.7 (also warnings towards 1.8)
* [django-markdown-deux](https://github.com/trentm/django-markdown-deux)

Current status
--------------

Application is in usable state. It would be probably difficult to incorporate it in your project doe to templates and authentification which are somehow egocentric. Use it as standalone app.


Expected audience
-----------------

If you are more experienced then me, or you are enthuisiastic student of Django and you want to collaborate, welcome to my club. I want to learn how to paricipate in collaborative work too. :-)
